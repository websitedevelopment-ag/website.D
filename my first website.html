<p>As much as 95% of all dreams are quickly forgotten shortly after waking. According to one theory about why dreams so difficult to remember, the changes in the brain that occur during sleep do not support the information processing and storage needed for memory formation to take place.</p>
<h2>Not All Dreams Are in Color</h2>
<p>While most people report dreaming in color, there is a small percentage of people who claim to only dream in black and white</p>
<h2>Men and Women Dream Differently</h2>

and non-REM sleep.</p>
<h2>It's Possible to Control Your Dreams</h2>

<h2>You Are Paralyzed During Your Dreams</h2>
<p>The phenomenon is known as REM atonia and prevents you from acting out your dreams while you're asleep.</p>
<p>n some cases, this paralysis can even carry over into the waking state for as long as 10 minutes, a condition known as sleep paralysis.</p>
